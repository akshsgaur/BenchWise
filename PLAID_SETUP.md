# üè¶ Plaid Integration Setup Guide

## Overview
Your BenchWise app now has a complete Plaid integration that allows users to securely connect their bank accounts. When users click the "Connect Bank Account" button, they'll be redirected to Plaid Link (not a separate login page) - a secure, embedded widget that handles the bank connection flow within your app.

## ‚úÖ What's Been Implemented

### 1. Client-Side Integration
- ‚úÖ Installed `react-plaid-link` SDK
- ‚úÖ Updated `PlaidIntegration.js` to use real Plaid Link
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive error handling
- ‚úÖ Added loading states and user feedback
- ‚úÖ Proper PropTypes validation

### 2. Server-Side Integration
- ‚úÖ Plaid API client configuration
- ‚úÖ Link token creation endpoint
- ‚úÖ Public token exchange endpoint
- ‚úÖ Account data retrieval
- ‚úÖ Integration status checking
- ‚úÖ Database models for storing integration data

### 3. User Experience
- ‚úÖ Secure embedded Plaid Link widget
- ‚úÖ Real-time connection status
- ‚úÖ Detailed error messages
- ‚úÖ Loading indicators
- ‚úÖ Automatic dashboard updates after connection

## üîß Setup Requirements

### 1. Plaid Account Setup
1. Go to [Plaid Dashboard](https://dashboard.plaid.com/)
2. Create a free account
3. Get your `PLAID_CLIENT_ID` and `PLAID_SECRET` from the dashboard
4. Note: You'll start in sandbox mode for testing

### 2. Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in your `BenchWise/server` directory with:

```env
# Database Configuration
MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string

# Server Configuration
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5000

# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d

# OAuth Configuration (if using)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID=your-microsoft-client-id
MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET=your-microsoft-client-secret

# Plaid Configuration (REQUIRED)
PLAID_CLIENT_ID=your-plaid-client-id
PLAID_SECRET=your-plaid-secret
PLAID_ENV=sandbox

# Frontend URL
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. Testing with Sandbox
For testing, you can use these sandbox credentials:
- **Username**: `user_good`
- **Password**: `pass_good`
- **PIN**: `1234` (if required)

## üöÄ How It Works

### 1. User Flow
1. User visits `/dashboard`
2. If no bank connected, sees PlaidIntegration component
3. Clicks "Connect Bank Account" button
4. Plaid Link widget opens (embedded in your app)
5. User selects their bank and enters credentials
6. Plaid handles authentication securely
7. On success, user is redirected back to dashboard
8. Dashboard shows connected bank info

### 2. Technical Flow
1. **Link Token Creation**: Server creates a secure link token
2. **Plaid Link**: Client opens Plaid Link with the token
3. **Bank Authentication**: User authenticates with their bank
4. **Public Token Exchange**: Plaid returns a public token
5. **Access Token**: Server exchanges public token for access token
6. **Data Storage**: Bank account data is stored in database
7. **Dashboard Update**: UI updates to show connected accounts

## üîí Security Features

- **Bank-Level Security**: Plaid handles all sensitive operations
- **Read-Only Access**: Your app only reads data, never modifies accounts
- **Encrypted Storage**: Access tokens are securely stored
- **No Credential Storage**: Bank credentials never touch your servers
- **PCI Compliance**: Plaid handles all compliance requirements

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Failed to initialize bank connection"**
   - Check if `PLAID_CLIENT_ID` and `PLAID_SECRET` are set
   - Verify server is running on correct port
   - Check network connectivity

2. **"Authentication failed"**
   - User needs to log in to your app first
   - Check JWT token validity

3. **"Invalid bank connection"**
   - User may have cancelled the Plaid flow
   - Try connecting again

4. **Plaid Link not opening**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify link token is being created successfully

### Debug Steps:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check server logs for API errors
3. Verify environment variables are loaded
4. Test with sandbox credentials first

## üì± Testing the Integration

1. **Start your servers**:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - Server
   cd BenchWise/server
   npm run dev

   # Terminal 2 - Client
   cd BenchWise/client
   npm start
   ```

2. **Navigate to dashboard**: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`

3. **Click "Connect Bank Account"**

4. **Use sandbox credentials**:
   - Username: `user_good`
   - Password: `pass_good`

5. **Verify success**: Dashboard should show connected bank info

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Set up Plaid account** and get your credentials
2. **Add environment variables** to your server
3. **Test the integration** with sandbox credentials
4. **Customize the UI** if needed
5. **Deploy to production** when ready
