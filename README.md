> **Empowering 65+ million American freelancers and gig workers with intelligent financial tools designed for variable income.**

## 🎯 Mission Statement

BenchWise bridges the financial inclusion gap for freelancers, gig workers, and independent earners who are underserved by traditional personal finance tools. Using advanced AI and behavioral economics, we provide personalized financial guidance that adapts to the unique challenges of variable income streams.

## 🚨 The Problem

- **Financial illiteracy** costs gig workers an average of $1,230/year in missed opportunities
- **Limited access** to personalized financial advice (traditional advisors cost $200+/hour)
- **Banking discrimination** - 22% of gig workers are underbanked or unbanked
- **Income volatility stress** affects 78% of freelancers' mental health and financial planning ability
